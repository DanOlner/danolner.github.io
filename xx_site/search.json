RStudio just makes it for you! With some tweaks.\nA place to explain what I’ve done with R projects - not least explaining them to future me. Future me is very forgetful and needs to have things laid out clearly.\nGet down the techie bits behind work I’m doing to support regional economic data analysis, so I can keep that separate from things like the regional economic tools site (also Quarto).\n\n*Links to my github / linkedin / bluesky / wordpress site (or use links up above).\nHere is a picture of a kitten on a unicorn, via here.

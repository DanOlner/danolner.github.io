(If anything doesn't make sense, do let me know at d dot olner and gmail dot com).\n\n[^1]: Installing R can be tricky on work machines if your organisation isn't familiar with it. R needs to access the internet to install libraries, for instance, and this can sometimes hit firewall issues. If you end up having this problem, I suggest trying the online posit.cloud route for now.\n\nYou'll need to do **one** of the following:\n\n1.  **Use RStudio in your browser with a [posit.cloud account](https://posit.cloud)**. The **free version** is limited (small memory, for instance) but **it's still a great option for non-intensive task and getting to know R with little effort**. The next section below talks through setting up in posit.cloud.\n\n2.  **Install R and RStudio on your own computer**. If you have a machine where you're able to install your own software [then go here](https://cran.rstudio.com/) to download/install the right version of R for your operating system, and [here to download/install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (again, pick the correct one for your OS). (Though see bullet point 2 below if using a work machine.)\n\n-   The next chunk will talk through **setting up a posit.cloud project.**\n-   The chunk after that talks through getting started with an RStudio project, and will **be nearly the same** whether you're using RStudio online or on your machine (with just one tweak, explained in the breakout box).\n\nAny questions/issues, let me know at d dot older at sheffield dot ac dot uk or [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danolner/) and I'll try to answer.\n\n## If using RStudio online: set up a posit.cloud account and create your RStudio project\n\nHere's the steps to get up and running through a browser using posit.cloud.\n\n-   [Create an account at posit.cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/login) - follow that link and use the ‘don’t have an account? Sign up’ box. **It’ll ask you to check your email for a verification link**, so do that before proceeding.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Once verified, go back to the posit.cloud tab and log in. You should see a message: “You are logged into Posit. Please select your destination”. Choose ‘Posit Cloud’ (**not Posit Connect Cloud**). **That’ll take you to your online workspace.**\n\n-   Click the **new project** button, top right\n\n-   Depending on what you want to do, either:\n\n    -   If you want the Tidyverse ready to go (but it's a slightly older R version): select '**new project from template**' (as in the pic below) and then \"Data Analysis in R with the tidyverse\" (if not already selected). This template comes pre-installed with the tidyverse package, which we'll be using. Select then click OK down at the bottom. **This will open your RStudio project where we'll do the coding. NOTE: if I'm posting examples using posit cloud, I'll let you know if the older R version is a problem. Mostly it's fine.**\n\n    -   Otherwise, just select 'new RStudio project' for an entirely blank instance of R where you'll need to install all libraries (but it's the latest R version).\n\n![](newproject.png)\n\n## Make a new R script and add a library\n\nNow you should **either be in RStudio online through posit.cloud** or **if using RStudio installed on your own computer, open that now**. From here...\n\n-   **Create a new R script** by going to 'file \\> new file \\> new R script' (or using the **CTRL+SHIFT+N** shortcut). A new script will appear, currently just called *'Untitled1'* until it's saved for the first time.\n-   **At this point, it should look something like this:**\n\n![](rstudio_online.png)\n\nLet's stop for a moment and look at the separate windows in RStudio.\n\n-   **Bottom left is the console**. Commands run here. You can test it by clicking in the console and trying a random command or two like those below (press enter to run a command in the console).\n\n(Note that all code blocks in this post have a **little 'copy to clipboard' icon in the top right** when you hover, if you want to just copy the code for pasting into RStudio).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr e.g.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(49)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Bottom right of the RStudio window has various tabs, including local **files** (all kept inside your project folder so everything is self contained) and a list of available **packages**[^2].\n\n[^2]: You can treat the terms 'package' and 'library' as interchangeble in R, but if you want to know the reason: if packages are like books, libraries are where the books are stored - we use the same name as the package to load a library. One of many examples of R being unnecessarily confusing with its language!\n\n::: callout-note\n## NOTE: IF USING RSTUDIO ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER...\n\nIf you're using posit.cloud, this package comes pre-installed in the template we selected. However, **if you're using RStudio on your own machine, you will need to install the tidyverse package yourself** if you want to use it (you probably will).\n\nTo do this, just **run the following code in the console** (the same place we just did our '2+2' test, in the bottom left panel in RStudio.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\n```\n:::\n\n\n**You should get a confirmatory message once the package has installed successfully** (though it may take a minute or two).\n:::\n\nNow, whether in posit.cloud or on your own computer, you should have the tidyverse package available.\n\n**It now needs to be loaded as a library** before we can use it:\n\n-   **Put the following text at the top of the newly opened R script in the top left panel.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen you've put that in, **the script title will go red**, showing it can now be saved (it should look something like the image below).\n\n![](script1.png)\n\n-   **Save the script** either with the CTRL + S shortcut, or file \\> save. Give it whatever name you like, but note that it **saves into your self-contained project folder.**\n\n## Running code in an R script / loading the tidyverse library\n\nAll code will run in the console - what we do with scripts is just send our written code to the console. We do this in a couple of ways:\n\n1.  In your R script, if no code text is highlighted/selected, RStudio will **Run the code line by line** (or chunk by chunk - we'll cover that in the taster session).\n2.  If a block of text is highlighted, the whole block will run. So e.g. if you select-all in a script and then run it, the entire script will run.\n\nLet's do #1: **Run the code line by line**.\n\n-   **To test this, we'll load the tidyverse library with the code we just pasted in** (which is just one line of code at the moment!) Put the cursor at the end of the `libary(tidyverse)` line in the script (if it's not there already), either with the mouse or keyboard. (Keyboard navigation is mostly the same as any other text editor like Word, but [here's a full shortcut list](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE) if useful.)\n-   Once there, either use the 'run' button, top right of the script window, or (much easier if you're doing this repeatedly) **press CTRL+ENTER to run it.**\n\nYou should see the code get sent to the console, and a message like the one below confirming that R is 'Attaching core tidyverse packages'. **The tidyverse library is now loaded**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**That's it!** Any questions/issues, let me know at d dot olner at gmail dot com or [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danolner/).\n",

"Another blog! Thank the Gods! Blogging is so _now_, isn't it?"

That's quite enough sarcasm from you. What this lovely website is for:

* Using the ace [Quarto blogging platform](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) for writing up data / techie / code / mapping stuff in a much more straightforward way than using Jekyll (the previous github frontend, now archived [here](http://danolner.github.io/archived-jekyll-site-danolner.github.io/)). RStudio just makes it for you! With some tweaks. Github repo for this blog is [here](https://github.com/DanOlner/danolner.github.io).
* A place to explain what I've done with R projects - not least explaining them to future me. Future me is very forgetful and needs to have things explained very simply to him.
* Get down the techie bits behind work I'm doing to support regional economic data analysis, so I can keep that separate from things like the [regional economic tools](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/) site (also Quarto).

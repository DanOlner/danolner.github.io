## Using R and RStudio: (1) posit.cloud in the browser, or (2) running on your own computer

This little guide gets you set up with R and RStudio - either online with posit.cloud through a browser, or with R and RStudio installed on your own computer[^1] - and talks through opening up a first R script and using it. (If anything doesn't make sense, do let me know at d dot olner and gmail dot com).

[^1]: Installing R can be tricky on work machines if your organisation isn't familiar with it. R needs to access the internet to install libraries, for instance, and this can sometimes hit firewall issues. If you end up having this problem, I suggest trying the online posit.cloud route for now.

You'll need to do **one** of the following:

1.  **Use RStudio in your browser with a [posit.cloud account](https://posit.cloud)**. The **free version** is limited (small memory, for instance) but **it's still a great option for non-intensive task and getting to know R with little effort**. The next section below talks through setting up in posit.cloud.

2.  **Install R and RStudio on your own computer**. If you have a machine where you're able to install your own software [then go here](https://cran.rstudio.com/) to download/install the right version of R for your operating system, and [here to download/install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (again, pick the correct one for your OS). (Though see bullet point 2 below if using a work machine.)

-   The next chunk will talk through **setting up a posit.cloud project.**
-   The chunk after that talks through getting started with an RStudio project, and will **be nearly the same** whether you're using RStudio online or on your machine (with just one tweak, explained in the breakout box).

Any questions/issues, let me know at d dot older at sheffield dot ac dot uk or [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danolner/) and I'll try to answer.

## If using RStudio online: set up a posit.cloud account and create your RStudio project

Here's the steps to get up and running through a browser using posit.cloud.

-   [Create an account at posit.cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/login) - follow that link and use the ‘don’t have an account? Sign up’ box. **It’ll ask you to check your email for a verification link**, so do that before proceeding.

<!-- -->

-   Once verified, go back to the posit.cloud tab and log in. You should see a message: “You are logged into Posit. Please select your destination”. Choose ‘Posit Cloud’ (**not Posit Connect Cloud**). **That’ll take you to your online workspace.**

-   Click the **new project** button, top right

-   Depending on what you want to do, either:

    -   If you want the Tidyverse ready to go (but it's a slightly older R version): select '**new project from template**' (as in the pic below) and then "Data Analysis in R with the tidyverse" (if not already selected). This template comes pre-installed with the tidyverse package, which we'll be using. Select then click OK down at the bottom. **This will open your RStudio project where we'll do the coding. NOTE: if I'm posting examples using posit cloud, I'll let you know if the older R version is a problem. Mostly it's fine.**

    -   Otherwise, just select 'new RStudio project' for an entirely blank instance of R where you'll need to install all libraries (but it's the latest R version).

## Make a new R script and add a library

Now you should **either be in RStudio online through posit.cloud** or **if using RStudio installed on your own computer, open that now**. From here...

-   **Create a new R script** by going to 'file \> new file \> new R script' (or using the **CTRL+SHIFT+N** shortcut). A new script will appear, currently just called *'Untitled1'* until it's saved for the first time.
-   **At this point, it should look something like this:**

![](rstudio_online.png)

Let's stop for a moment and look at the separate windows in RStudio.

-   **Bottom left is the console**. Commands run here. You can test it by clicking in the console and trying a random command or two like those below (press enter to run a command in the console).

(Note that all code blocks in this post have a **little 'copy to clipboard' icon in the top right** when you hover, if you want to just copy the code for pasting into RStudio).

```{r}
2+2
```

Or e.g.

```{r}
sqrt(49)
```

-   Bottom right of the RStudio window has various tabs, including local **files** (all kept inside your project folder so everything is self contained) and a list of available **packages**[^2].

[^2]: You can treat the terms 'package' and 'library' as interchangeble in R, but if you want to know the reason: if packages are like books, libraries are where the books are stored - we use the same name as the package to load a library. One of many examples of R being unnecessarily confusing with its language!

## NOTE: IF USING RSTUDIO ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER...

If you're using posit.cloud, this package comes pre-installed in the template we selected. However, **if you're using RStudio on your own machine, you will need to install the tidyverse package yourself** if you want to use it (you probably will).

To do this, just **run the following code in the console** (the same place we just did our '2+2' test, in the bottom left panel in RStudio.)

```{r eval=F}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

**You should get a confirmatory message once the package has installed successfully** (though it may take a minute or two).
:::

Now, whether in posit.cloud or on your own computer, you should have the tidyverse package available.

**It now needs to be loaded as a library** before we can use it:

-   **Put the following text at the top of the newly opened R script in the top left panel.**

```{r eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

When you've put that in, **the script title will go red**, showing it can now be saved (it should look something like the image below).

![](script1.png)

-   **Save the script** either with the CTRL + S shortcut, or file \> save. Give it whatever name you like, but note that it **saves into your self-contained project folder.**

## Running code in an R script / loading the tidyverse library

All code will run in the console - what we do with scripts is just send our written code to the console. We do this in a couple of ways:

1.  In your R script, if no code text is highlighted/selected, RStudio will **Run the code line by line** (or chunk by chunk - we'll cover that in the taster session).
2.  If a block of text is highlighted, the whole block will run. So e.g. if you select-all in a script and then run it, the entire script will run.

Let's do #1: **Run the code line by line**.

-   **To test this, we'll load the tidyverse library with the code we just pasted in** (which is just one line of code at the moment!) Put the cursor at the end of the `libary(tidyverse)` line in the script (if it's not there already), either with the mouse or keyboard. (Keyboard navigation is mostly the same as any other text editor like Word, but [here's a full shortcut list](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE) if useful.)
-   Once there, either use the 'run' button, top right of the script window, or (much easier if you're doing this repeatedly) **press CTRL+ENTER to run it.**

You should see the code get sent to the console, and a message like the one below confirming that R is 'Attaching core tidyverse packages'. **The tidyverse library is now loaded**.

```{r echo = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

**That's it!** Any questions/issues, let me know at d dot olner at gmail dot com or [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danolner/).

## What's this page?

* A live list of stuff I've made in my policy fellow role, working with [Y-PERN](https://y-pern.org.uk/), University of Sheffield [Management School](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/management) and [SYMCA](https://www.southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk/).
* I'll add to this same post as new stuff appears.
* I'll also use this to note where I think a piece of work might go next, what's missing, what else it connects with.



## Outputs

[RegEconTools website](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/). All of this work comes under the broad heading of "Open regional economic data and tools"; this website is where I'm collating as much of it as I can. [Here's the website repo](https://github.com/DanOlner/RegionalEconomicTools).

### On the RegEconTools website currently:

* Resource: Linked [regional GVA and job count data](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/regionalgva_n_bres.html), including more accurate BRES job counts[^1].
* Explainer / R guide: [location quotients and proportion plots](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/sector_locationquotients_and_proportions.html) for UK regional secotrs: processing and mapping (using the above data).
* Explainer / R guide: [analysing regional GVA gaps](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/gdp_gaps.html) (using the above data). Breaking down by ITL2, ITL3, core cities and mayoral authorities.
* Explainer / R guide: [comparing different GVA productivity measures](https://danolner.github.io/RegionalEconomicTools/beattyfothergill.html) using Beatty & Fothergill's range of metrics.

### Other outputs:

* South Yorkshire 'Plan for Good Growth' [sector analysis summary](https://www.southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk/getmedia/75e687c5-a6b5-40c1-ad0c-73344f64f084/SYMCA_Plan-for-Good-Growth_analysis.pdf) document (PDF) hosted by [SYMCA](https://www.southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk/plan-for-good-growth). This highlights some key sector ideas that went into informing the Plan (a small part of a large team's work, including [Metro Dynamics](https://www.southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk/getattachment/0fde98ad-f890-4b5a-8e80-0c02972ba37f/South-Yorkshire-Plan-for-Growth-Economic-Analysis.pdf)).
